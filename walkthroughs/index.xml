      <description>Kernel Debugging with WinDbg Lab 10 This chapter explore ways to use WinDbg for kernel debugging and rootkit analysis.
Lab 10-1 Does this program make any direct changes to the registry ? The user-space program calls the ControlService function. Can you set a breakpoint with WinDbg to see what is executed in the kernel as a result of th ecall to ControlService ? What does this program do ? Lab 10-2 Does this program create any files ?</description>

      <description>OllyDBG Lab 9 I choose x64DBG instead of OllyDBG because I found the HMI better, and I feel more familiar with the tool.
Lab 9-1 How can you get this malware to install itself ? Firstly, let&amp;rsquo;s put the malware in the debugger. The program is immediately pauses once it hits the entrypoint.
At 0x402AFD, the number of argument is compared to 1. I didn&amp;rsquo;t set any parameters when starting the debug.</description>

      <description>1 - A) Given what you learned about CALL and RET, explain how you would read the value of EIP ?
EIP is used to save the return address after a CALL or a RET for example. In this way, the program will resume correctly and it can continue the execution flow.
I&amp;rsquo;ll use a CALL to a function to modify EIP. Inside this function, we have to save the value of EIP inside a register.</description>

      <description>Question This function uses a combination SCAS and STOS to do its work. First, explain what is the type of the [EBP+8] and [EBP+C] in line 1 and 8 respectively. Next explain what this snippet does.
01: 8B 7D 08 mov edi, [ebp+8]02: 8B D7 mov edx, edi03: 33 C0 xor eax, eax04: 83 C9 FF or ecx, 0FFFFFFFFh05: F2 AE repne scasb06: 83 C1 02 add ecx, 207: F7 D9 neg ecx08: 8A 45 0C mov al, [ebp+0Ch]09: 8B AA mov edi, edx10: F3 AA rep stosb11: 8B C2 mov eax, edx Analysis EBP is a pointer referencing the bottom of the stack.</description>

      <description>Analyzing Malicious Windows Program Lab 7 The goal of this lab is to help understand how a malware interact with the operating system.
Lab 7-1 How does this program ensure that it continues running (achieves persistence) when the computer is restarted ? In the main function, there is a StartServiceCtrlDispatcher API call which allow to connect the thread of a service process to the service control manager. The name of the service is MalService.</description>

      <description>Recognizing C Code Constructs Lab 6 The goal of this labs is to help understand the overall functionality of a program by analyzing code constructs.
Lab 6-1 What is the major code construct found in the only subroutine called by main ? The subroutine called by the main is located at 0x401000.
In this function we can see a jz statement. The choice of the path to follow depend on the result of the comparison that his made with EAX.</description>

      <description>Discovering IDA Pro Lab 5 This lab use the file Lab05-01.dll. It has to be analyze only on IDA Pro. This is my first experience with this tool.
What is the address of DllMain ? The address of DllMain can be find in the Functions Windows by default on the left side of your screen. It starts at 0x1000D02E.
Also, you can visualize it on the Graph View by turning on Line Prefixes in the settings.</description>

      <description>Basic Dynamic Analysis Lab 3-1 This lab uses the files Lab03-01.exe.
What are this malware&amp;rsquo;s import and strings ? We use PE Explorer to answer this question with the imports button at the top of the tool.
There is only one DLL used and one function imported. We know that the malware isnâ€™t pack with UPX, NsPack or Upack because when you open the executable with PE Explorer, by default it try to unpack it with those 3 algorithms.</description>

      <description>Basic Static Analysis Lab 1-1 This lab uses the files Lab01-01.exe and Lab01-01.dll.
Upload the files to http://wwww.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signature ? a) Lab01-01.exe
Virus Total detected a potential Trojan. The signature (MD5) of the malware is bb7425b82141a1c0f7d60e5106676bb1
50/70 positifs antivirus
b) Lab01-01.dll
The signature of the malware is 290934c61de9176ad682ffdd65f0a669
42/67 positifs antivirus
Signature of malware can be generated with WinMD5..</description>
